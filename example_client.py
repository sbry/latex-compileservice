"""
    This script contains examples of working with the LaTeX compile service via the HTTP/JSON API.

    This code is in python3, but deliberately no special python client libraries specific to the
    service are used here, so the interaction with the API should translate to any other language
    and framework.

    This script uses the test files included in the repository, so will need access to the
    contents of the ./tests/test_files directory.  The directory itself can be changed as needed
    with the TEST_FILE_DIRECTORY constant.

    As is standard practice for Python, the third party 'requests' module is used. Install with
    'pip install requests' or 'pip3 install requests' depending on your environment if you don't
    already have it installed.
